# Peterbu-Farms

Marcello Peterbu coordinates the farm share program for his familyâ€™s farm. Besides the traditional vegetable and fruit shares, the Peterbu farm share has also been expanded to include meat and dairy options for its members.
Marcello is reviewing the farm share sales data from the last few years to see how best to expand the program. He first wants to create a line chart of the total sales from the farm shares over a four year period.
